2007/07/15 (TS):
	- Various (small) changes to host test program:
		* use -fno-common (and a few explicit ini- statements) to make sure
		  all variables are initialized to zero.
		  This resolved strange effects (different results for different
		  runs with same parameters) which were traced to undef.
		  initialization states.
		* added '-P' option so that poll-interval can be set independent
		  of PLL time-constant.
		* call 'display()' at every 'tick' rather than only when poll-interval
		  expires.
2007/07/02 (TS):
	- install timex.h into include/sys
2007/06/22 (TS):
	- removed global 'poll-interval' variable. We should use the NTP
	  internal that can be set via ntp_adjtime() so that NTP knows
	  what the poll interval is.
